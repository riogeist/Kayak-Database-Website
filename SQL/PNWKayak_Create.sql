end of the scale, several of these factors may be combined. Scouting is 
recommended but may be difficult. Swims are dangerous, and rescue is often 
difficult even for experts. Proper equipment, extensive experience, and 
practiced rescue skills are essential. Because of the large range of difficulty 
that exists beyond Class IV, Class V is an open-ended, multiple-level scale 
designated by class 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, etc. Each of these levels is an order of 
magnitude more difficult than the last. That is, going from Class 5.0 to 
Class 5.1 is a similar order of magnitude as increasing from Class IV to 
Class 5.0.'),

the extremes of difficulty, unpredictability and danger. The consequences of 
errors are severe and rescue may be impossible. For teams of experts only, at 
favorable water levels, after close personal inspection and taking all 
precautions. After a Class VI rapid has been run many times, its rating 
may be changed to an appropriate Class 5.x rating.');

('Canyon Creek of the Lewis', 'Just a short distance north of Portland, 
Canyon Creek is a popular run for the after work crowd once daylight savings 
time hits. Dedicated paddlers also paddle this run before work in the winter 
for their morning adrenaline fix, or do multiple laps if they have more time. 
While it takes a little longer your first time down, you can bomb down the 
run in an hour once you know the lines.  This river is a unique and valued 
whitewater resource for local paddlers and a destination for paddlers from 
around the world who make Portland a stop on their whitewater road trips. 
Consistent flows throughout all but the dry summer months, accessibility to 
the Portland paddling community, and great rapids make this a unique 
whitewater resource with significantly more available user days than many 
comparable runs in the region. The race course from Thrasher down to the 
Hammering Spot is widely regarded as one of the best sections in the country 
for a creeking race.'),
('White Salmon', 'The White Salmon River is a 44-mile tributary of the 
Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington. Originating on the slopes of 
Mount Adams, it flows into the Columbia Gorge near the community of 
Underwood. Parts of the river have been designated Wild and Scenic. The 
principal tributaries of the White Salmon River include Trout Lake and Buck, 
Mill, Dry, Gilmer, and Rattlesnake Creeks.'),
('Clackamas', 'The Clackamas River is located to the west of the Cascade 
Range and to the south of the Columbia River Gorge in northern Oregon. 
Flowing northwest from its sources high in the Cascade Mountains, the 
designated portion of the river, which is 47 miles in length, runs from Big 
Spring (headwaters area) to Big Cliff, just south of the town of Estacada. 
This most picturesque region is entirely within the Mt. Hood National Forest 
and encompasses forested lands, wetlands, riparian areas and rock cliffs.'),
('Sandy', 'The Sandy River originates in the high glaciers of Mt. Hood, the 
most prominent peak in Oregons Cascade Mountains. Riverside trails offer 
spectacular scenery, easily observed geologic features, unique plant 
communities and a variety of recreational opportunities. Just outside 
Portland, the lower reaches of the Sandy River flows through a deep, winding, 
forested gorge known for its anadromous fish runs, botanical diversity, 
recreational boating and beautiful parks.'),
('Hood', 'The Hood River, formerly known as Dog River, is a tributary of the 
Columbia River in northwestern Oregon, United States. Approximately 25 miles 
long from its mouth to its farthest headwaters on the East Fork, the river 
descends from wilderness areas in the Cascade Range on Mount Hood and flows 
through the agricultural Hood River Valley to join the Columbia River in the 
Columbia River Gorge.');

Salmon is named "The Farmlands" after the nearby farms that the river

waterfall. Lava Falls and some of the harder rapids can be portaged

do a few portages.'),

Salmon, this is a run on which a great many kayakers have cut their class 3 
teeth. On a hot afternoon, the cold, clear water, nice lunch spots, and good 
play spots draw rafters and kaykers to thei scenic canyon. The rapids are 
fairly continuous, especially during the first few miles. Be aware of Husum 
Falls at the end of the run.'),

from Three Lynx to North Fork is a great 13 mile winter/spring run close to 
Portland, OR. Youll experience continuous class II/III whitewater with some 
class 4 excitement thrown in. This is among the most popular rafting trips 
in northern Oregon due to its proximity to Portland, great whitewater, 
camping opportunities, and classic Pacific Northwest scenery. Oregon 224 
follows the river which makes it easy to scout rapids and to do a shorter 
run.'),
('Sandy Gorge', 4, 9, 1, 5, '42', '12.8', 'The Sandy Gorge is a great, 
pool drop, class 3-4 run just a little over an hour away from Portland. 
This is a great run, with a handful of fun pool drop rapids and boulder 
gardens. However, it often collects wood, so paddle with caution, keep 
your eyes open, and do your best to get the most recent beta on any new 
wood.'),
('Revenue Bridge to Dodge Park', 4, 3, 1, 5, '40', '5', 'This is a 
delightful stretch that feels remote and has mostly class 2 feel except 
for a couple of class 3 rapids near the end of the run.  Keep your 
eyes peeled for the great surfing waves especially in some of the 
shelfier sections.  '),
('Tucker Bridge to Hood River Marina', 5, 7, 1, 5, '66', '7.5', 'The Dee 
to Tucker stretch of the Hood River is a classic Class 4 run in the Columbia

full day trip.'),
('Dee to Tucker', 5, 9, 1, 5, '60', '5', 'The Hood River starts on the 
northern side of Mt. Hood in Oregon and is a tributary to the Columbia River. 
A popular day-trip for Columbia River Gorge natives since the removal of the 
Powerdale Dam in 2010, the Lower Hood run from Tucker Bridge to the Columbia 
River is beautiful and tons of fun. Perfect for kayakers and rafters alike, 
the river generally runs half the year from November to June depending on 
rain and snowmelt. The water is typically continuous Class 3 water with 
potential Class 4 consequences. At high water (above 6 ft.) the river 
becomes a definite Class 4 run. Youll boat through a small forested canyon 
with awesome views of Mt. Hood when clouds are minimal. In Spring it is 
typical to see Great Blue Heron, Merganser and Harlequin ducks, and hundreds 
of swallows swooping to and fro across the river.');

Creek and plunges 20 feet into a large pool. There is a class 3 lead-in rapid 
but a eddy on the river right at the lip allows for a scout and offers a good 
spot to stage for the drop. There is an obvious ramp on the right side of the 
falls where a delayed boof will yield a clean line. Both of the walls 
flanking the drop are somewhat undercut. There is no simple portage option so 
those not running the falls will need to toss their boats and jump. After the 
pool, there are a pair of class 3 rapids that can be junky at low water 
before the next horizon line of note.'),
('Champagne', 1, 10, '10', 'The Grand Finale of Canyon Creek is Champagne

scouted and portaged on the right side. There is a rope just up from the 
scout/portage ledge incase you need to climb out. It is possible to climb 
back into the canyon just above Triple Drop but it is very steep and requires 
some down climbing. Just below here the river goes through a narrow canyon 
that often has wood making it a bad place to swim.'),
('BZ Falls', 3, 11, '14', 'BZ Falls is by far the burliest drop on the 
White Salmon but lots of boaters run it these days. Three people have drowned 
here, all paddlers of some sort but no hard shell kayakers that I know of. 
All lost their lives when they ended up in the horrific hydraulic/undercut 
combination at the base of this falls. The lead-in to BZ is a fast 3+ drop 
with a sizable hole that you must run on the right in order to catch one of 
three small eddies just above the falls. Several paddlers have blown it here 
and been swept over the falls, so stay alert!'),
('Big Brother', 3, 11, '25', 'Big Brother is a drop that is commonly run 
at high flows and low flows... but in the medium flows is commonly walked. 
The danger is the cave that has claimed one life in the landing on the right. 
At low flows it is less in play and less consequential, at high flows you can 
go left. If you get to run it, the feeling of boofing as hard as you can from 
this height is quite fun. Scout either side, portage on the left.'),
('Double Drop', 3, '11', '18', 'Double Drop is a class 5 eighteen foot 
double falls that plunges down through two huge holes. Those not familiar 
with the river should be careful approaching the falls, especially when the 
river is high. There is a rapid leading right into Double Drop, so keep an 
eye out. Double Drop is usually pretty forgiving, unless you fall into it 
sideways. People who have run this drop have done so backwards, upside down, 
upside down and backwards, it is rare to get worked here.'),
('Little Brother', 3, 10, '15', 'Located just below Big Brother, Little 
Brother is a fun drop to do multiple laps on. In a modern high volume 
creekboat the falls can be run any way you want. That said, a paddler broke 
his boat on the bottom here back in the eighties so if you are paddling a 
longer old-style kayak you might want to boof with right angle.');
